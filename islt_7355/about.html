            <h3><b>About Myself</b></h3>
            <p>Hello, it is nice to meet everyone. My name is Leanne Williams. I am pursuing a Master’s in Library Information Science at Mizzou. My hobbies include reading, writing, friendly debates, traveling, and trying new foods. My goals in life are to become a public librarian and a fantasy writer. Becoming a writer is something that I have wanted to do since I was about seven years old. Libraries have always been my safe haven. I want to learn web design and development so that I am able to market myself when the time comes. The other reason is that I want to be able to create many learning tools and web pages for patron usage when I become a librarian. Ultimately, I hope to do many things in my life.</p>
        
            <h3><b>Education Overview</b></h3>
            <p>I have a bachelor’s in History from the University of Missouri - Kansas City. I am currently enrolled in a Master’s in Library Information Science from the University of Missouri - Columbia. My estimated graduation date is May, 2024</p>
