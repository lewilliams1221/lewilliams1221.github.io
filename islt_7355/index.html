                    <h3><b>About Myself</b></h3>
                    <p>Hello, it is nice to meet everyone. My name is Leanne Williams. I am pursuing a Master’s in
                        Library Information Science at Mizzou. My hobbies include reading, writing, friendly debates,
                        traveling, and trying new foods. My goals in life are to become a public librarian and a fantasy
                        writer. Becoming a writer is something that I have wanted to do since I was about seven years
                        old. Libraries have always been my safe haven. I want to learn web design and development so
                        that I am able to market myself when the time comes. The other reason is that I want to be able
                        to create many learning tools and web pages for patron usage when I become a librarian.
                        Ultimately, I hope to do many things in my life.</p>

                    <h3><b>Purpose</b></h3>
                    <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase my skill, knowledge, and experience in the field of
                        library information science, with the goal to obtain a career as a public or academic librarian.
                        The objectives of this website are to provide my resume in video and in document format, outline
                        core competencies and projects in my Master’s program that have prepared me for a career in
                        library information science, a personal reflection, as well as a contact page.</p>
