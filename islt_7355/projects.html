            <p>Lib guide/pathfinder - In the IS_LT 7314 Reference sources and Services, one main project was to create a pathfinder for patron usage. This is my LibGuide, with the topic of worldbuilding in fiction writing: https://lis-missouri.libguides.com/c.php?g=1280537. In this pathfinder, I provide resources and information on how to craft a fiction world using videos, encyclopedias, other fiction works to take examples from, and “writing events near you”. Here I learned how to design information in a way that is most accessible to people.</p>
        
            <p>IS_LT 7361 Intro to digital media - This class taught me how to create digital media in an instructional way. For instance, our final was to create a video that included music, transitions, voice-over audio, and visual content to teach a concept to an audience. This digital media class taught me to be mindful of how I’m relaying information for better understanding, as well as the best possible ways to teach a general audience how to do something.</p>
        
            <p>IS_LT 7301 Introduction to Library Information Science - In this class, I learned the fundamentals of what a library informational professional does, and why. I learned that library information science is constantly changing with the technological-based society we live in and that it’s important to keep evolving and learning new things to stay professionally relevant and impactful.</p>
