            <div class="a">
                <p>My course program experiences have enhanced my understanding of what the library information science
                    field will look like once I’ve graduated. Foundations of Library Information Science, Introduction
                    to Library Information Sciences, Resources sources and Services have given me the experience to
                    comfortably handle patron interaction as well as create and develop tools for instructional purposes
                    to better serve the needs of my community. This includes a deeper understanding of the challenges
                    that my community may face and trying to bridge that gap.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b">
                <p>Introduction to Library Information taught me the core concepts in library practice, which are to
                    uphold the American Library Association’s values. These include, but are not limited to: access to
                    information and services, confidentiality and privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong
                    learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social
                    responsibility, and sustainability.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><b>Web Learning</b></h3>
            <div class="b">
                <p>Reference Sources and Services taught me how to create a pathfinder with these core concepts in mind,
                    as well as enacting a reference exchange with a fellow classmate. For instance, in order to create
                    something that could be viewed for general purposes, I needed to first make sure that it was
                    accessible to everyone. This included spreading information to reduce scrolling, creating an upward
                    arrow (again, to reduce scrolling), and to create bigger font size, as well as using general words
                    to convey concepts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b">
                <p>Lastly, the digital media class taught me how to implement ideas through digital means. This is a
                    part of library evolution in the last thirty years, so it is important to be able to function and
                    have knowledge of digital tools and technologies for reaching through planes of virtual realities to
                    deliver information and teaching. With this in mind, I will use this experience to become a
                    well-rounded librarian who is open to change.</p>
