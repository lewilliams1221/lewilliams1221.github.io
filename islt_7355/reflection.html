            <h3><b>Personal Reflection</b></h3>
            <div class="a">
                <p>My course program experiences have enhanced my understanding of what the library information science field will look like once I’ve graduated. Foundations of Library Information Science, Introduction to Library Information Sciences, Resources sources and Services have given me the experience to comfortably handle patron interaction as well as create and develop tools for instructional purposes to better serve the needs of my community. This includes a deeper understanding of the challenges that my community may face and trying to bridge that gap.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b">
                <p>Introduction to Library Information taught me the core concepts in library practice, which are to uphold the American Library Association’s values. These include, but are not limited to: access to information and services, confidentiality and privacy, democracy, diversity, education and lifelong learning, intellectual freedom, the public good, preservation, professionalism, service, social responsibility, and sustainability.</p>
            </div>

            <h3><b>Web Learning</b></h3>
            <div class="b">
                <p>Reference Sources and Services taught me how to create a pathfinder with these core concepts in mind, as well as enacting a reference exchange with a fellow classmate. For instance, in order to create something that could be viewed for general purposes, I needed to first make sure that it was accessible to everyone. This included spreading information to reduce scrolling, creating an upward arrow (again, to reduce scrolling), and to create bigger font size, as well as using general words to convey concepts.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="b">
                <p>Lastly, the digital media class taught me how to implement ideas through digital means. This is a part of library evolution in the last thirty years, so it is important to be able to function and have knowledge of digital tools and technologies for reaching through planes of virtual realities to deliver information and teaching. With this in mind, I will use this experience to become a well-rounded librarian who is open to change.</p>
