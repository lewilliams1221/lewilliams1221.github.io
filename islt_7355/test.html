            <h1>Hello, it is nice to meet everyone.</h1> 
        <h3>My name is Leanne Williams.</h3> 
        <p>I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Library Information Science at Mizzou. 
            My hobbies include reading, writing, friendly debates, traveling, and trying new foods. 
            My goals in life are to become a <em><strong>public librarian and a fantasy writer</strong></em>.</p>
        <p> Becoming a writer is something that I have wanted to do since I was about seven years old. Libraries have always been my <em><strong>safe haven</strong></em>. <br />I want to learn <em><strong>web design and development</strong></em> so that I am able to market myself when the time comes. <br />The other reason is that I want to be able to create many learning tools and web pages for patron usage when I become a <strong>librarian</strong>.</p>
            
            <p> Ultimately, I hope to do many things in my life.</p>

            Starting with the next workshops you will be able to create your own webpages.
